How To Embed A Photo Slideshow from Google Plus Picasa
November 1, 2013Phil Johnson
Picasa GalleryApparently back in March 2013 or so Google changed up their whole online Picasa deal and didn’t include the option to embed a gallery slideshow on other sites.  And now all your Picasa albums forward over to Google Plus pages.  Super dumb, yeah?
I was trying to find a way to do so for a photo gallery inside the VIP Members Area of my artist site.  After some digging, here’s what I came up with.
What You’ll Learn
The “back door” into the old Picasa
Your quick 4-step process to getting the embed code for your Picasa gallery.
There’s a back door way to sneak back into the old Picasa.  Use this URL: https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/myphotos?noredirect=1
That turns off the redirect to Google+ and you only need to click it once.  Your browser will remember after that.
Once inside Picasa, follow these steps:
1. Click on the album you want to embed
2. On the right side, click “Link to this album” then “Embed Slideshow”
3. That will kick up a little popup with some parameters you can set any way you like.
4. Copy the code and paste is wherever you want it.
And voila! A nifty little slideshow like the one below.

so this link is the backdoor.

on bootstrap and less for layout

re-building is better in the end... (they are just commercials or.. not really customizing..)

# customizing @ official site also possible..

# or get a copy and do less re-compile bootstrap 3 locally also nice. (fast!)
